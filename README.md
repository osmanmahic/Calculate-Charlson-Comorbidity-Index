# Overview
This repository contains simple R code for calculating the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), a weighted index that accounts for both the number and severity of comorbid conditions. Note that lymphoma and leukemia are included under the condition "malignancy". Additionally, because the study population consisted exclusively of patients with end-stage kidney disease, all individuals were assigned a default score of 2 points. For further details, refer to Deyo et al. (1992).

## Requirements
- R (version 4.1.3 or higher)
- `dplyr` (for data wrangling)
